            <p>- Farthest planet from the Sun, blue giant with strong winds. <br>
                - Similar in composition to Uranus. <br>
                - Notable moon Triton orbits in the opposite direction of Neptune's rotation. <br>
                - Magnetic field undergoes rapid changes. <br>
                - Great Dark Spot observed by Voyager 2 has disappeared. <br>
                - Neptune's winds are the fastest in the solar system, reaching speeds of up to 1,500 miles per hour. <br>
                - Triton, Neptune's largest moon, has a retrograde orbit and potential cryovolcanism. <br>
                - Voyager 2 is the only spacecraft to have visited Neptune, passing by in 1989. <br>
                - Neptune's atmosphere contains methane, giving it a blue color. <br>
                - Neptune's magnetic field is tilted relative to its rotation axis. <br>
