            <h2>MERCURY</h2>
            <p>- Second densest and smallest planet, resembling Earth in structure. <br>
                - Named after the Roman messenger god. <br>
                - Closest to the Sun at 57.91 million km, completing an orbit in 88 Earth days. <br>
                - No known satellites or ring systems. <br>
                - Thin exosphere, extreme surface temperatures (800°F day, -290°F night). <br>
                - Mercury's surface features scarps and smooth plains, indicating geological activity. <br>
                - Water ice is present in permanently shadowed craters at Mercury's poles. <br>
                - It has a radius of 2,439 km and a diameter of 4,879 km. <br>
                - Despite its proximity to the Sun, it is not the hottest planet; Venus holds that title. <br>
                - Mercury's magnetic field is offset relative to the planet's equator. <br>
