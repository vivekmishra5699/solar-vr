                - Moderate temperatures suitable for life. <br>
                - Magnetic field protects from solar wind and cosmic rays. <br>
                - Rotates every 24 hours, orbits the Sun in 365.25 days. <br>
                - Dynamic surface with oceans, forests, and deserts. <br>
                - Earth's magnetic poles are not aligned with its geographic poles, causing geomagnetic secular
                variation. <br>
                - Highest point on Earth is Mount Everest, standing at 29,032 feet. <br>
                - Earth-Moon system is unique, with the Moon being relatively large compared to other moons in the solar
                system. <br>
                - Ozone layer absorbs harmful ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. <br>
                - Earth's axial tilt causes seasons, and its rotation is gradually slowing over time.</p>
